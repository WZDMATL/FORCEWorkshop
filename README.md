## Description

This coding template was created to serve as a template for a coding workshop for students between the ages of 4 to 18. The FORCE Workshop was a 5-location tour held in 2021 and taught 200+ students in Georgia HTML5, CSS3, and JS.

## How it's built

### Data
A majority of the website's page content is stored in the <code>/src/</code> directory and in an HTML file. I started with index.html and then created the src folder to store the css file, js file and an additional html file (links.html). The images are placed in the <code>/images/</code> folder.
